<h5>How to make Mangalorean Chicken Ghee Roast Recipe
    To begin making the Mangalorean Chicken Ghee Roast Recipe, wash and clean the chicken thoroughly and drain all the water.
    
    To Marinate the Chicken
    In a mixing bowl, add curd, turmeric and lemon juice and mix well. Add the washed chicken pieces in the curd mixture and marinate for at least 1 hour. 
    
    For the ghee roast masala
    Heat a flat skillet and add dry red chilies, fenugreek seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cloves and peppercorns. Roast them on low flame till the aroma of the spices wafts through the air. Turn off the flame and allow to cool. 
    
    Once the spices are cool, add them to a mixer jar along with the garlic and tamarind paste along with a tablespoon of water into a smooth paste. Keep it aside. 
    
    Heat a kadai with ghee, add curry leaves and allow it to crackle. Now, lower the flame and add chicken that is marinated with curd into the kadai and cook until the chicken has become firm. 
    
    Add the ghee roast masala into the kadai and mix everything together until it combines. Cook the chicken in the pan until the ghee separates out and reaches the surface. 
    
    Finally add in the jaggery, salt to taste and mix well. Once the jaggery has melted, mix well and check for seasoning. Switch off the heat and serve hot.
